# 📚Exam Generator Website
 This is my 🏆first ever project just seconds after learning the basics of HTML, CSS & JavaScript. One of my traits is that I am always eager to learn and do the best I can. Exams were 8 months away and due to my newly acquired skills I built a website just so I could easily test my knowledge everywhere I go. During the development of this project, some of my classmates were also interested in my project. Helping myself in this case ended up helping other people too :)
